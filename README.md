# Subscription-Through-App-Behavior-Analysis

We will do the customers churn analysis based on the customers behavior on the website or app. We will classify what kind of customers are likely to sign up for the paid subscription of a website. After analyzing 
and classifying the dataset, we will be able to do the targeting based 
marketing or recommendation to the customers who are likely to sign up 
for the paid subscription plan.

For this problem we will use Logistic Regression algorithm from scikit-learn library. The dataset for this problem has been optimized with necessary feature engineering that has already been done. If you wanna find out how I cleaned the data and how the feature engineering was done, please stay tuned as i will be writing another post soon about the data cleaning process on this particular dataset.


At last, So we can say that our model is doing the right job and a descent job with LogisticRegression.

We can further optimize our model using different parameter tuning methods. But for now I am not going to optimize this model. If you want to learn about parameter/hyper parameter tuning, you can search GridSearch, Randomized search, Backward elimination. Iâ€™ll leave those for next post.

This is my first medium post, so please feel free to give me suggestions and constructive criticism on this post and also about the method Iused to do this classification. Thank you.
